1. Not Having a Partner Page
APIs are digital products, and their packaging should reflect that. The job of the partner page is to convert visitors into API consumers. To do this effectively, the page should instantly catch the attention of your desired crowd through the use of a Unique Selling Proposition (USP). This must be a short statement that answers the questions:

How is your API different?
What is the primary reason for its existence?
Why should someone start using it right now?
It also has to connect emotionally with your target audience. Twilio’s USP, for example, is “Build powerful Voice & SMS applications.” Who doesn’t want to have a powerful voice? After holding a visitors attention long enough for them to continue reading, you need to warm this lead more by communicating the benefits of consuming your API. Don’t forget: there is a difference between listing features and conveying benefits. Do the latter without neglecting the former! This is your chance to help them understand what you can deliver, so use words, images, and video to ensure that the message is clear.

Finally, close the deal by having a powerful Call to Action (CTA). This is where you give those who are actively listening a chance to take action. Ask yourself: what is it you would like the target customers to do, and what benefit do they receive from doing so? Here are a few examples:

Recognize that you will not connect with everyone, but always make sure that everyone understands clearly what you have said. Also, ensure that this page is sharable by making it useful; link to reference documentation, interactive documentation, tutorials and support.
