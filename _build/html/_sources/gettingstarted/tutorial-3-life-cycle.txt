Alert De-duplication, Correlation and Status Changes
====================================================

In this introduction you will learn how alerts are de-duplicated and how
to employ the built-in simple event correlation to reduce alert noise.

**Contents**

  * `Alert reception`_
  * `De-duplication`_
  * `Simple Correlation`_
  * `Status Changes`_

Alert reception
---------------

Alerts sent to Alerta must define at the very least a ``resource``
and an ``event``.

Alert De-duplication
--------------------

An alert is considered a duplicate if the same ``resource`` and ``event``
is received with a


Simple Correlation

Status Changes
--------------

de-dup
correlation

pre-receive
post-receive

3. bespoke monitoring
- demo de-duplication and simple correlation (alerts are cheap, send lots)
- resource not host-centric
- multiple services
- use of env (and customer) to namespace resource
- status auto-assigned by server


  - with and without Auth

  - correlation & de-duplication
